# Survey questions

Whether or not you contribute to the Rust Project <https://github.com/rust-lang>
today, we want to hear from you!

The Rust Foundation has created this survey to help us identify the main
problems negatively affecting active, past, and potential contributors to the
Rust Project to help us plan programs that can most effectively support the
contributors and maintainers of the Rust Project.

Unless you choose to enter your email, your answers will be anonymous. Any
personal data you submit as a part of this survey will be handled in accordance
with our policy as described in our Frequently Asked Questions:

https://github.com/rust-community/team/wiki/State-of-the-Rust-Language-Community-Survey-FAQ

We estimate it will take about ? minutes to complete.
