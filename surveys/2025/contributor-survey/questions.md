# Survey questions

This survey is organized by the Rust Leadership Council. Its goal is to figure out how much Rust Project contributions/work done by Rust Project members is funded vs. how much is volunteer-based. We want to use the results of this survey to secure more funding sources for Rust Project contributors and maintainers in the future.

This survey is only aimed at Rust Project members. **If you are not a member of any Rust team/working group/project group/etc., please DO NOT fill this survey**. It is also primarily aimed at "active" contributors, who made at least some contribution in the past 12 months.

Note that when we ask about contributions in this survey, we always mean contributions to the Rust Project repositories, so essentially any repository under the `rust-lang` GitHub organization, plus any other related organizations, such as `rust-lang-nursery` or `rust-analyzer`.

This survey is anonymous. Summarized statistics of the survey results might be published publicly. You can optionally choose to answer selected personal questions at the end of the survey, which will only be made available to the Rust Leadership Council and Rust Foundation staff.

### When have you started contributing to the Rust Project?

Type: select one (optional)

- During 2025
- During 2023 or 2024
- During 2021 or 2022
- During 2019 or 2020
- During 2018 or before
- I did not ever contribute to the Rust Project [`NEXT`](<END>)

### Are you funded for your Rust Project contributions?

Type: select one

- Yes, I am currently funded for (at least some of) my contributions [`NEXT`](#how-much-time-do-you-spend-contributing-to-the-rust-project-monthly)
- No, but I was funded before
- No, I never received any funding for them [`NEXT`](#how-much-money-would-you-like-to-be-paid-for-contributing-to-the-rust-project)

### Why are you not funded anymore?

Type: select all that apply (optional)

- I left an employment that funded my contributions
- I have been laid off from an employment that funded my contributions
- A contract that funded my contributions has not been renewed
- A grant ran out
- Individual sponsors (e.g. GitHub sponsors) stopped sponsoring me
- I cannot receive funds anymore due to legislation (e.g. visa or student status) 
- Other (open response)

### How much time do you spend contributing to the Rust Project monthly?

Estimate how many hours do you spend on Rust Project contributions each month. If this varies wildly, try to provide an average monthly duration over the past 12 months.

This includes all kinds of contributions, such as programming, writing tests or documentation, triaging issues, investigating bugs, discussing on Zulip or GitHub, meetings, doing code reviews, etc. Include also work indirectly related to the Rust Project; for example, if you are employed to work on Rust and attend periodic internal meetings related to your work, this time should also be included. 

Enter the value as an integer, e.g. *50*.

Type: free form (optional)

### How much of your time spent on Rust Project contributions is funded?

Estimate how much of the time that you spend on contributing to the Rust Project is funded. For example, if you spend 20 hours per week contributing, and a company pays you for 10 hours of contributions per week, then approx. 50% of your contribution time is funded.

If you are not funded per-hour, but with a flat rate, attempt to convert the number of received funds to an hourly rate. For example, if you receive $1000 for your Rust Project contributions per month, your normal hourly rate is $100, and you spend 30 hours per month contributing on average, then approx. 33% of your time is funded.

If the ratio changes over time, try to estimate the average ratio over the past 12 months.

Enter the value as an integer percentage, e.g. *50*.

Type: free form (optional)
