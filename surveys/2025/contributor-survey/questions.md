# Survey questions

This survey is organized by the Rust Leadership Council. Its goal is to figure out how much Rust Project contributions/work done by Rust Project members is funded vs. how much is volunteer-based. We want to use the results of this survey to secure more funding sources for Rust Project contributions in the future.

This survey is only aimed at Rust Project members. If you are not a member of any Rust team/working group/project group/etc., please do not fill this survey. It is also primarily aimed at "active" contributors, who made at least some contribution in the past 12 months.

Note that when we ask about contributions in this survey, we always mean contributions to the Rust Project repositories, so essentially any repository under the `rust-lang` GitHub organization, plus any other related organizations, such as `rust-lang-nursery`.

### When have you started contributing to the Rust Project?

Type: select one (optional)

- During 2025
- During 2023 or 2024
- During 2021 or 2022
- During 2020 or 2019
- During 2018 or before
- I do not contribute to the Rust Project [`NEXT`](<END>)

### How much of your time spent on Rust Project contributions is funded?

Estimate how much of the time that you spend on contributing to the Rust Project is funded. For example, if you spend 20 hours per week contributing, and a company pays you for 10 hours of contributions per week, then approx. 50% of your contribution time is funded.

If you are not funded per-hour, but with a flat rate, attempt to convert the number of received funds to an hourly rate. For example, if you receive $1000 for your Rust Project contributions per month, your normal hourly rate is $100, and you spend 30 hours per month contributing on average, then approx. 33% of your time is funded.

If the ratio changes over time, try to estimate the average ratio over the past 12 months.

Enter the value as an integer percentage, e.g. *50*. If you do not receive any funding for your Rust Project contributions, enter *0* or leave the answer blank.
